# This or That

Welcome to "This or That" â€“ a fun and interactive project where you get to make choices and see how your preferences compare to others. The application presents users with pairs of options, and users can choose which one they prefer. After making a selection, the app displays the percentage of people who chose each option for that specific combination.

## Technologies Used

- **Bun**: The project utilizes Bun as a fast alternative to node.

- **HonoJS**: HonoJS is used for the web server, it's lightweight, simple and uses Web Standards. I also made use of the JSX rendering to avoid needing any template engine which was nice.

- **Prisma**: Prisma serves as the database layer, using SQLite in this poject.

- **Tailwind**: Tailwind CSS is used for styling, but the styles were kept pretty simple in the project.

- **Vite**: Vite was added to use typescript for the vanilla js and to bundle the styles. I manually added in the hot reloading for development too.

## Features

- **Option Pairing**: Users are presented with two options and are prompted to choose their preference between the given pair.

- **Percentage Display**: After making a selection, the application displays the percentage of people who chose each option for that specific combination.

- **Scoreboard**: A dynamic scoreboard keeps track of the most answered combinations, showcasing popular choices within the community.

- **JSX Rendering with Vanilla JS**: The project leverages the JSX rendering capabilities of Bun along with vanilla JavaScript for handling the functionality, resulting in a clean and efficient codebase.
